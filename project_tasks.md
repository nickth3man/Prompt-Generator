# Prompt Generator Project Tasks

## Project Overview

The Prompt Generator is a PyQt5-based application for creating different types of educational prompts:

1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
2. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)
3. Active Prompting
4. Persona-based Prompting

## Task Tracking

### Completed Tasks

- Initial application development
- Partial refactoring into modular structure with:
  - `src/prompt_generator/models/` - Data models for prompts and prompt management
  - `src/prompt_generator/ui/` - UI components and forms
  - `src/prompt_generator/utils/` - Utility functions, settings management
  - `src/prompt_generator/resources/` - Application resources
- Complete refactoring of main application (`prompt_generator_pyqt.py`) into the new modular structure:
  - Created `src/prompt_generator/app.py` as the main application module
  - Created UI components in separate modules:
    - `src/prompt_generator/ui/header.py`
    - `src/prompt_generator/ui/sidebar.py`
    - `src/prompt_generator/ui/content.py`
    - `src/prompt_generator/ui/footer.py`
    - `src/prompt_generator/ui/preview.py`
    - `src/prompt_generator/ui/welcome.py`
  - Created a main entry point script (`main.py`)
  - Created `setup.py` for package installation
  - Created `requirements.txt` for dependency management
- Creating and setting up project task tracking
- Implemented several improvements to the application:
  - Enhanced settings management with new options for keyboard shortcuts, history tracking, and export formats
  - Added theme management system for dark/light mode support
  - Added keyboard shortcuts management
  - Added history tracking for created prompts
  - Added template management system
  - Added export functionality to multiple formats (TXT, Markdown, HTML, JSON)
  - Updated header UI to include theme toggle button
- Fixed linting issues in key files:
  - Fixed linting issues in `settings.py` including blank lines with whitespace, line length, and bare except statements
  - Fixed linting issues in `export_manager.py` including blank lines with whitespace and line length issues
- Cleaned up project structure:
  - Moved redundant files to a safe directory for reference
  - Removed old version of `settings.py` from root directory
  - Moved `prompt_generator_pyqt.py` to safe directory as it's been refactored
